## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Purple (#9C42FF) to convey a sense of innovation and sophistication.
- Background color: Off-white (#F8F8F8) to provide a clean and airy canvas, allowing the purple primary color to stand out. A background color in this hue helps ensure excellent contrast with the main content.
- Accent color: Green (#27D47B), analogous to purple, but contrasting, to highlight key interactive elements, creating a sense of forward progress and automation.
- Font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and easily readable design. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Employ a mobile-first, responsive design ensuring seamless adaptation across devices, including vertically stacking columns for optimal viewing on smaller screens.
- Use card layouts with rounded corners and a subtle shadow to elevate elements, providing visual depth and enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.
- Integrate simple, geometric icons in the integrations sections to visually represent the app categories (e.g., car for commute, graph for stock, heart for dating).
